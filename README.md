## My name is Nikola Ignjatovic, I am 21 years old software developer from Serbia. 

### About repositories:
Some of the repositories are on Serbian.
That's because I was either working for Serbian clients or with a Serbian team.
Most of the repositories that are on Serbian language are older. 

If you don't understand documentation or you have any questions or issues feel free to hit me up via email at ignjatovic.nikola2002@gmail.com.

Even though it says repositories were created in specified time that doesn't mean that the projects were created at that time (they were created earlier but I stored them on HDD). I put them on GitHub to store them online after some time.

> Have fun and happy coding ğŸ‘‹
